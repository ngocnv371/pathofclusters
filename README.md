In Path of Exile: Delirium, we're introducing Cluster Jewels which can be placed in the outermost sockets of your Passive Skill Tree. These jewels expand your passive tree and provide powerful new possibilities for your character builds. There are 280 new notables for you to utilise in your builds. Today's news unveils them all.

Many of these jewels also create more jewel sockets which means you can branch quite far outside your tree if you want to heavily invest in these passives.

There are three sizes of jewel - Large, Medium and Small, each with a different focus. Large jewels may be placed in the outermost passive skill tree sockets and focus on offensive bonuses. Medium jewels can be placed in the outermost passive skill tree sockets or a socket created by a large jewel and they focus on specific mechanics and utility effects. Small cluster jewels can be placed in sockets created by Large or Medium jewels and sockets on the outermost parts of the passive skill tree. Small jewels focus on defences.

Cluster Jewels can be crafted using all of the same methods that you're used to using with other Path of Exile items. Like other jewels, they can have up to two prefixes and two suffixes. It's worth noting that the number of passive skills added by the jewel and the effect of the small nodes are both enchantments, not implicit mods. This means that they cannot be rerolled with Blessed Orbs, and will not be overwritten if you add a corruption-exclusive implicit mod to the jewel.
